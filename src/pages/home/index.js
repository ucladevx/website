          <h5>
            Have you ever felt that all you were learning at UCLA was theory,
            with little opportunities to build out practical applications? DevX
            is a brand new program dedicated to solving that very problem! Build
            out real-world projects to help tackle pressing problems frustrating
            the UCLA community, grow your technical skills by pairing up with
            experienced students, and build a network that lasts beyond
            graduation.
