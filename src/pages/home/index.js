          <h5>
            Have you ever felt that all you were learning at UCLA was theory,
            with little opportunities to build out practical applications?
            <br />
            <br />
            DevX is a brand new program dedicated to solving that very problem!
            Build out real-world projects to help tackle pressing problems
            frustrating the UCLA community, grow your technical skills by
            pairing up with experienced students, and build a network that lasts
            beyond graduation.
